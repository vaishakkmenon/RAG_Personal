# Personal Projects

## Personal Projects Summary

I have built several personal projects demonstrating expertise in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and cloud infrastructure. My personal projects include a FastAPI RAG Service (a retrieval-augmented generation chatbot), a GPT From Scratch implementation (a decoder-only transformer architecture), and a Music Genre Classification system (a CNN-based audio classifier). These personal projects showcase my skills in machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, retrieval systems, and software development.

## FastAPI RAG Service

I built and tuned a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chatbot using FastAPI, ChromaDB, and LLaMA models. This personal project demonstrates my expertise in RAG systems, vector databases, large language model integration, and building production-ready AI applications. The FastAPI RAG Service is a complete retrieval-augmented generation system that combines semantic search with generative AI.

I developed this RAG service with reproducible evaluations on the SQuAD v2 dataset using 500 examples. The system achieved strong performance metrics including an F1 score of approximately 0.54, NoAnswer recall of approximately 0.92, and median latency around 130 milliseconds. The retrieval component of the RAG system achieved Recall@5 of approximately 0.85 and Hit@1 of approximately 0.65, demonstrating effective semantic search capabilities.

This personal project showcases my ability to build machine learning systems, implement retrieval-augmented generation architectures, work with vector databases like ChromaDB, integrate large language models, and create performant FastAPI applications. The project demonstrates practical application of machine learning and AI technologies in a real-world retrieval system.

## GPT From Scratch

I developed a decoder-only flash transformer architecture from scratch in Python, demonstrating deep understanding of transformer architectures, attention mechanisms, and large language model internals. This personal machine learning project implements the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture without using pre-built transformer frameworks.

I built this GPT implementation as a personal project to understand the fundamental components of modern large language models. The implementation includes multi-head attention, positional encodings, layer normalization, and the complete decoder architecture. One version of the model I developed is publicly available on Hugging Face for the machine learning community.

This personal project demonstrates my expertise in deep learning, transformer architectures, natural language processing, and machine learning model development from first principles. Building a GPT model from scratch required in-depth knowledge of attention mechanisms, neural network architectures, and training large language models.

## Music Genre Classification

I built a machine learning project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify audio spectrograms into music genres. This personal AI project demonstrates my expertise in computer vision, deep learning, and audio processing. I developed a CNN-based model that processes audio spectrograms and predicts music genres with improved accuracy.

The Music Genre Classification system I built improved classification accuracy by 5-10% over traditional machine learning baselines including k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest models. This improvement demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning approaches for audio classification tasks.

This personal machine learning project showcases my skills in convolutional neural networks, computer vision techniques applied to audio data, model training and evaluation, and comparative analysis of machine learning approaches. The project combines audio processing, spectrogram analysis, and deep learning classification.
