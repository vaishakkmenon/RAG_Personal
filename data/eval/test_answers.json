My graduate GPA is 4.00 [1].\n\n**Work Experience**\n\nI have worked at two organizations throughout my career. I served as a Computer Science Teaching Assistant at the University of Alabama at Birmingham from August 2022 to May 2025, where I taught and mentored students in data structures, algorithms, and systems programming. I also completed three summer internships as an Infrastructure Intern at Maven Wave Partners in Chicago, Illinois, working consecutively in the summers of 2021, 2022, and 2023.\n\n**Personal Projects**\n\nI have built several personal projects demonstrating expertise in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and cloud infrastructure. My personal projects include a FastAPI RAG Service (a retrieval-augmented generation chatbot), a GPT From Scratch implementation (a decoder-only transformer architecture), and a Music Genre Classification system (a CNN-based audio classifier).\n\n**Coursework**\n\nI have taken a total of 45 courses across my undergraduate and graduate programs. My grade distribution was:\n\n- **A grades:** 44 courses (98%) - All courses except one received an A\n- **B grades:** 1 course (2%) - Only CS 350 (Automata/Formal Langs) received a B grade\n- **C grades or below:** 0 courses\n\nSome of my notable courses include:\n\n- CS 660 (Artificial Intelligence)\n- CS 662 (Natural Language Processing)\n- CS 410 (Database App Dev)\n- CS 420 (Software Engineering)\n- CS 436 (Computer Security)\n- EE 233 (Engineering Programming Method)\n- CMST 101 (Public Speaking)\n\n**Certifications**\n\nNo certifications are mentioned in the provided documents.\n\n**Technical Skills**\n\nMy technical skills include expertise in machine learning, artificial intelligence, cloud infrastructure, and software development. I have hands-on experience with Google Cloud Platform, Kubernetes, Terraform, and Infrastructure as Code practices.\n\n**Programming Languages**\n\nNo specific programming languages are mentioned in the provided documents.\n\n**Academic Achievements**\n\nI earned a 4.00 GPA in Fall Term 2022 and Fall Term 2023 (Dual Enrollment - Graduate Courses). I also earned a B grade in CS 350 (Automata/Formal Langs) in Spring Term 2022.",
